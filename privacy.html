<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2025-09-13 04:00 UTC</em></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Workday Timer widget (“Service”) handles data when you connect your Notion workspace.</p>

<h2>What we access</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Notion databases named <strong>Clients</strong>, <strong>Projects</strong>, and <strong>Time Log</strong> (or IDs you configure).</li>
  <li>Basic metadata necessary to create/read time entries you request.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we store</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access token:</strong> stored locally in <code>localStorage</code> in <em>your browser</em>. It is sent with each request to run the action you asked for (e.g., “log time”).</li>
  <li><strong>We do not persist your token or content on our server.</strong> Netlify may process requests transiently to deliver the function.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we write to Notion</h2>
<p>When you click Pause/Stop, we create a row in your <strong>Time Log</strong> with date, minutes, and relations to the chosen Project and Client. We may also create those items only if your configuration allows it (your current build uses “projects-only”, which <em>does not</em> create items).</p>

<h2>Analytics & cookies</h2>
<p>No analytics are built in. The widget uses localStorage for preferences (theme, weekly goal, most recent selection). No third‑party cookies are set by the widget.</p>

<h2>Subprocessors</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Netlify</strong> – hosts this site and runs serverless functions.</li>
  <li><strong>Notion</strong> – API provider you authorize.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data retention</h2>
<p>We don’t keep copies of your workspace data. Your time entries live inside your Notion databases until you delete them.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>Because we don’t hold your personal data on our servers, requests to access or delete your data can be fulfilled by you directly in Notion (delete pages/rows) and by revoking access to the integration in Notion: <em>Settings &rarr; My connections</em>.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
